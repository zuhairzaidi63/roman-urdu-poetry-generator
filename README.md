# Poetry Generation Project

This project explores the creation of poetry using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The goal is to generate human-like, creative poems based on a given prompt or theme, utilizing pre-trained language models such as GPT-2, GPT-3, or custom RNN-based models.

## Project Overview

The Poetry Generation Project leverages deep learning models to generate creative, meaningful poems based on user-provided input. It utilizes advanced NLP models to understand and generate verses, stanzas, and rhymes, creating poetry that mimics human-like creativity.

## Key Features

- **Creative Poetry Generation**: Generate poems from a variety of themes and prompts, such as love, nature, and life.
- **Pre-trained Language Models**: Use powerful pre-trained models like GPT-2 or GPT-3 to generate high-quality text.
- **Customizable Output**: Users can specify a length, theme, or style of poem, and the model will adapt its output.
- **Rhyming and Structure**: The system can be configured to generate poems with specific rhyme schemes and meter.
- **User Interaction**: Allows users to interactively input prompts and get generated poems in real-time.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language for NLP and machine learning models.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: To use pre-trained language models like GPT-2 and GPT-3.
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**: Deep learning frameworks for training models (if applicable).
- **NLTK**: For natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and more.
- **Flask / Streamlit**: For creating a web interface or interactive platform for poem generation.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/poetry-generation.git
    cd poetry-generation
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Alternatively, if you're using a web interface:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

4. Enter a theme or prompt when prompted, and the model will generate a poem.

## Example Usage

1. Run the script with a command line prompt:

    ```bash
    python generate_poem.py --prompt "A poem about the beauty of the night"
    ```

    This will generate a poem with the given theme.

2. If using a web interface (e.g., Streamlit or Flask), input a prompt like:

    > "Write a poem about the changing seasons."

    The system will then generate a poem based on this input.
