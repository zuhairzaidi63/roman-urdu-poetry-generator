# Poetry Generation Project

This project explores the creation of poetry using LSTM. The goal is to generate human-like, creative poems based on first line of poem.

## Project Overview

The Poetry Generation Project leverages deep learning models to generate creative, meaningful poems based on user-provided input. It utilizes advanced NLP models to understand and generate verses, stanzas, and rhymes, creating poetry that mimics human-like creativity.

## Key Features

- **Creative Poetry Generation**: Generate poems from a variety of themes and prompts, such as love, nature, and life.
- **Customizable Output**: Users can specify a length, and the model will adapt its output.
- **User Interaction**: Allows users to interactively input prompts and get generated poems in real-time.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language for NLP and machine learning models.
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning frameworks for training models (if applicable).
- **NLTK**: For natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and more.
- **Streamlit**: For creating a web interface or interactive platform for poem generation.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/poetry-generation.git](https://github.com/zuhairzaidi63/roman-urdu-poetry-generator.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Alternatively, if you're using a web interface:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

4. Enter a theme or prompt when prompted, and the model will generate a poem.

## Example Usage

1. If using a web interface (e.g., Streamlit or Flask), input a prompt like:

    > "aa√±kh se duur na ho dil"

    The system will then generate a poem based on this input.
